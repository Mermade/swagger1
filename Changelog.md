  - consumes.  Describes the input formats supported when receiving content

  - produces.  The output formats that the resource can produce

  - protocols.  The protocols supported by the resource (i.e. `http`, `https`, `ws`, `wss`)

  - authorizations.  The required authorizations for a resource

* The `.{format}` in the path is now optional and off by default

1.1.  This version contains mostly clarifications to ambiguous portions of the spec, including:

* Clarify supported primitives, case normalization of models.
